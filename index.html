        <h3>Software Engineering Student</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since I was a child, I've had a strong curiosity for how
          computers work. I spent countless hours exploring technology,
          experimenting with software, and teaching myself the basics of
          programming. That early fascination only grew stronger over time and
          became a defining part of who I am. <br /><br />

          I later attended SUGS Rade Jovcevski - "Korcagin" High School, where I
          built a solid academic foundation and continued to nurture my interest
          in technology. This passion naturally led me to pursue higher
          education at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI),
          where I am currently studying Software Engineering. <br /><br />

          I'm especially passionate about front-end development. I enjoy
          creating visually engaging and user-friendly interfaces that combine
          both creativity and logical thinking. Building websites that not only
          look good but also solve real problems is something I truly find
          fulfilling. <br /><br />

          Outside of the digital world, I have a big love for animals, and I'm
          also deeply fascinated by real estate and architecture. I find joy in
          observing how both physical and virtual spaces are designed to meet
          human needs. <br /><br />

          I'm someone who is constantly curious and motivated to learn. I
          believe that the tech world offers limitless opportunities to grow,
          create, and make a real impact — and I'm excited to be part of it.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I've always been captivated by the way websites combine design,
            interaction, and logic to create engaging experiences. Web
            development allows me to bring ideas to life in the browser —
            transforming simple layouts into responsive, dynamic platforms. I
            enjoy building clean, interfaces using modern frameworks and best
            practices that make every click feel natural and intuitive.

          <h3>Software engineering</h3>
          <p>
            For me, software engineering is more than just writing code — it's
            about solving problems in a structured, thoughtful way. I'm drawn to
            the process of architecting systems, optimizing performance, and
            creating maintainable codebases. Whether it's designing algorithms
            or collaborating on large-scale projects, I find joy in turning
            complex challenges into elegant, functional solutions.

          <h3>Real estate</h3>
          <p>
            Real estate has always been a strong personal interest of mine. I
            actively follow the housing and investment markets, track trends,
            and enjoy learning how location, design, and timing impact value.
            While my main focus is technology, I see real estate as a long-term
            side path — something I would love to be involved in professionally
            one day. It combines my curiosity for growth, strategy, and smart
            decision-making.
